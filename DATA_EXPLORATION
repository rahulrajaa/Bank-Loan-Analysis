Project Title : Analysis of Bank Loan Approvement

With the total number of applicants applied for bank loan and their financial background including the current loan
status dataset the analysis is performed prediction of loan approvement from a bank correlating to examine the volume
and the amount of issued loans.

Language and Technologies : Python , Pandas Library , Matplotlib Library,NumPy Library.

Tools Used: Pycharm.

Step 1:

Data Exploration is the first step to be done before the project to be created. Data exploration, cleaning and preparation can 
take maximum of your total project time.But it helps your project to get clear and accurate analysis.First, identify Predictor 
(Input) and Target (output) variables. Next, identify the data type and category of the variables. Letâ€™s look at these methods and 
statistical measures for categorical and continuous variables individually.

Let's move to code....

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Rahul/PycharmProjects/LoanDataset/loandataset.csv")  # Reading the dataset in a dataframe using Pandas

                                    # D A T A   E X P L O R A T I O N

Nan = df.fillna("Nan")
first_ten_rows = df.head(10)
summary = df.describe()
area_count = df['Property_Area'].value_counts()


print("First Ten Data:\n",first_ten_rows,"\n")
print("Summary:\n",summary,"\n")
print("Area Count:\n",area_count,"\n")



#(i) Using Boolean Indexing

Fem_Data1=df.loc[(df["Gender"]=="Female") & (df["Education"]=="Not Graduate") & (df["Loan_Status"]=="Y"),
                  ["Gender","Education","Loan_Status"]]

print("Female Non Graduates Who Got Loan\n",Fem_Data1,"\n")

F_S1 =Fem_Data1['Loan_Status'].count()

print("Total Female Non Graduates Who Got Loan\n",F_S1,"\n")


Fem_Data2=df.loc[(df["Gender"]=="Female") & (df["Education"]=="Graduate") & (df["Loan_Status"]=="Y"),
                  ["Gender","Education","Loan_Status"]]
F_S2 =Fem_Data2['Loan_Status'].count()
print("Total Female Graduates Who Got Loan\n",F_S2,"\n")

Mal_Data1=df.loc[(df["Gender"]=="Male") & (df["Education"]=="Not Graduate") & (df["Loan_Status"]=="Y"),
                  ["Gender","Education","Loan_Status"]]
M_S1=Mal_Data1['Loan_Status'].count()

print("Total Male Non Graduates Who Got Loan\n",M_S1,"\n")

Mal_Data2=df.loc[(df["Gender"]=="Male") & (df["Education"]=="Graduate") & (df["Loan_Status"]=="Y"),
                  ["Gender","Education","Loan_Status"]]

M_S2 =Mal_Data2['Loan_Status'].count()
print("Total Male Graduates Who Got Loan\n",M_S2,"\n")


#(ii)Using Function Creation
def num_missing(x):
  return sum(x.isnull())


M_C = df.apply(num_missing, axis=0)
print ("Missing values per column:\n", M_C,"\n")

M_R = df.apply(num_missing, axis=1).head()
print ("Missing values per row:\n", M_R,"\n")
